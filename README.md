BATTLE SHIP DESCRIPTION:
This is a very simple clone of the classic board game Battleship. Battleship is a two player game where each player starts with 5 game pieces. These game pieces are ships of different lengths represented by how many hits it can receive before being sunk. The game board for Battleship is quite different than most other games. This is because each player has a game board and each board is made up of two 'ten by ten' grids. On one grid, the player places his ships with a couple simple rules in mind. These rules are that all ships must lie completely inside the grid and no ships may be overlapping each other. After both players have placed their gamed pieces, the turn phase begins. The first player takes his turn by guessing a grid coordinate, from the 'ten by ten' grid, that he thinks the other player has a ship placed on. If the opponent does not have a ship on that square this is called a 'miss' and the calling player places a white peg on the grid coordinate of the second 'ten by ten' grid of his game board. If the opponent has a ship on the called grid coordinate this is called a 'hit' and the opponent places a red peg on the ship at the appropriate grid coordinate. The calling player also places a red peg on the second grid of his game board. If a ship has no more spaces for 'hit' pegs then it is considered sunk. Play passes with either a 'hit', 'miss', or 'sink' and continues until one player has sunk all the ships of the other player. The player that sinks all the other player's ships is the winner.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- The first iteration has limited colors and backgrounds and may never be updated.
